"咸鱼" in Cantonese, literally meaning "salted fish," is a slang term commonly used to describe a certain attitude or lifestyle.
It carries a metaphorical meaning beyond its literal translation.

In Cantonese, "Salty Fish" is often used to depict individuals who have a passive and laid-back approach to life. These individuals may lack motivation and ambition, simply going with the flow without actively pursuing any goals. When someone is referred to as a "Salty Fish," it is usually a criticism of their lack of drive, initiative, and determination.

However, "Salty Fish" also holds a positive connotation in Cantonese. It can be used to describe individuals who are calm, composed, and unaffected by external pressures. In this sense, being a "Salty Fish" represents a state of tranquility and detachment, where one chooses a simple and relaxed way of life. These individuals prioritize inner peace and contentment over
worldly achievements.

Moreover, the concept of "咸鱼翻身" (literally translated as "the salted fish turning over") extends the meaning of "Salty Fish" in Cantonese. It refers to a situation where a person undergoes a significant positive transformation or achieves success after a period of stagnation or setbacks. It embodies the idea of a reversal of fortune, where the once passive and idle "Salty Fish" becomes proactive and successful.
